# The Tale of the Lonely Dirac

For as long as it remembered Dirac knew that it was different. 

He was fired by his boss. So he would have no income to support his family--his wife and six children. He reminded himself to be stronger. But his tear could not be stopped.

To make a change, he went to the job market. But he was too old and there was no suitable job for him. Dirac didn't know how to do it.
