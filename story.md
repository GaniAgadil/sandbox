# The Tale of the Lonely Dirac

For as long as it remembered Dirac knew that it was different.
He hated the place and decided to take a long journey and ended up with a place with a long winter, Iowa.  :blush:
He could not find anything in Iowa, just snow, a massive pile of snow. :snowflake:


Meow Meow Cats are the best!

One day Dirac decided to get a pet cat.
